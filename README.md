# SHA-256 Encryption

This C program computes the SHA-256 hash of a user-provided text input using the OpenSSL library.

## Description

The program prompts the user to enter a text string. It then calculates the SHA-256 hash of the input string using the SHA-256 algorithm provided by the OpenSSL library. The resulting hash is displayed in hexadecimal format.

## Dependencies

- OpenSSL library: The program uses the SHA-256 implementation provided by the OpenSSL library.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/GaneshWagh0/SHA256-encryption.git
```

2. Navigate to the directory containing the source code:

```

3. Run the provided installation script to install dependencies, compile the program, and run it:

```
./encryption.sh
```

## Usage

1. Run the compiled program:

```
./encryption
```

2. Enter the text string you want to hash when prompted.

3. The program will display the SHA-256 hash of the input text.
